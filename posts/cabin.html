	<h2>cabin</h2>
	<pre>
this is an old song
that i sing to myself on these low winter nights
in a snowy cabin
i would pull all of the embers of the fire into myself
so i could ignite one last sentiment of youth and remembrance
and my soul would sing it too
yes, it will sing with glee
in tears and solemn reverence
first in murmurs
then in whispers
but then with great shouting
yet alas
there was no one in the room
but a still, quiet voice
and a subtle warmth on my shoulders

"when all the embers are finished and the fire is too tired
and the hot coffee in my mug is no more
i will lie in the snow
i will stop trying to be warm
frutilely resisting what we know shall be 
i will not get under the covers
in the comfort of my bed
i will give in to the seasons
making snow angels
and waiting to see god"

i did not build this cabin to live forever
and my fire will not burn indefinitely
i sip my coffee with gratitude
for i am here for a season and gone in the next

he built me this old cabin
to invite him inside
