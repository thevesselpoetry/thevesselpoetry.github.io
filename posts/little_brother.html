	<h2>Little Brother</h2>
	<pre>
Dear friend
Now where have you gone?
Just where do you think you’re going?
I didn’t know you were so ready to leave

Little brother
Couldn’t you have told someone?
If only I had caught you in the doorway
Maybe then we’d still be sitting on the porch
Under the moonlight on a summer day
Talking about your mom who’d passed on
And your dad you’d never met
From the very beginning
It was all a wreck

If only I had looked into your eyes
And called you little brother
Maybe then you would’ve answered
The last phone call I made to you

My deepest regret is that I stopped convincing you
To stay here
Where you had belonged for the present season
I was just too distracted to see
That your train was leaving
And that your bags were already packed

Nobody is sad that you went away, Lucas…
(We’ll all make that journey to the mountain)
We’re just torn apart because of the way that you did

You know, I could fill up page after page
Recounting the times we passed together
And how the world was a better place for the people
Who knew you
And how you made such a great and unforgettable impact
And how your voice still speaks from the train tracks

It would take hours to write all of that

I just wanted to say that I miss you
With the deepest, most painful, and most remorseful sadness
