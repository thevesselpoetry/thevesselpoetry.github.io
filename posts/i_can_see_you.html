	<h2>i can see you from this mountain</h2>
	<pre>
before it was only me in the hemisphere
there were a few faithful ones
who with many tears built empires
with their broken backs
they were not tied down by odd fixations
or impossible ideals
like i was when the globe spun like my dizzy head

it took so long for it to become what it did
and we waited for hours and months and years
then our hairs became gray
and the tiredness in our joints began to say
this will be a cure in a song
you can drink it like ale
or leave it dusty on the shelf
now what was that all about?

in those days i talked about the hemisphere
and the seven seas excitedly
as if i'd had a few cups of coffee
then it was you laughing until you were coughing
i could choke on those words all the more
and they meant nothing to me

used to we would see it all
from the high mighty mountain
come down when we were ready
and take it to the sea
(i always envied you for that)
now why is it so hard to crawl
out of the living room?
still i'll never be able to thank you
for all the generosity
that you bestowed on me

with many tears did they build a city
with their broken backs
(and with much weeping did they admit that)
