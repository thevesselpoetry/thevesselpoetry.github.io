It has been said and it shall certainly be said again
Love is madness
Nonsensical
Preposterous
Ridiculous
Impossible to be understood by spoken words
Or definitions in dusty lexicons

I will try my very best to describe
how I feel about you, my sweet love

When I look into a sapphire sky on a beautiful day
Or I glance into the raging sea at the Florida beach
Or if I gaze upon mighty mountains that tower above me
I cannot be so impressed
When I think of you

I shall try this again

When I think of how God must have thought of me
As he fashioned you to be as lovely as you are in my eyes
(And how you cannot see that with yours)
I feel lost
Lost in a constant wonder and a feeling
of gratitude and humility
Because I believe God made you for me

I certainly wasn't made to be alone...
(I was made for you)

When I am looking at you
I don't know what to think or say
Perhaps, you have already felt what I wanted express
And words are useless

I am not wrong to say that words are useless
They are utterly futile
I say that I love you and I look into your gorgeous eyes
I am thinking of how God shall allow me to serve you
to prove my love for you
I am thinking about painful seasons to come
I am thinking about in sickness and in health
Through trials and tribulations
I am waiting to say I love you
Not as I hold your lovely hands, my darling
But when all is falling apart
When it feels as if hope is coming undone at the seams

Perhaps, I waste my time describing love
When I know there shall be a time to for it to blossom as a rose
And show itself on its own
But there is one thing that I do know

Love never ends

My simple words will pass from my tongue and pen
Knowledge shall fade from my memory
and brittle pages shall fall out of old books
All pass away in their proper time
It is impossible to avoid the inevitable
But as long as I am alive, my darling
I will love you forever
